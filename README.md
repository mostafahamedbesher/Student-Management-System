# Student-Management-System

## Description

Developed a Database Management System utilizing the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure for efficient data handling. The system encompasses various features, including the addition and deletion of student records, student search functionality, and the computation of the total number of students. Executed the project using the Eclipse IDE. Named "Student Management System," this initiative reflects my capability in designing and implementing database systems with a focus on organized data processing and retrieval.
